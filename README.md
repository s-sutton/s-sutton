<h1>S. G. Sutton</h1>
I’m interested in vulnerability research and exploit development. I'm particulary interested in kernel and shell exploitations. I’m currently working on my certificates, all other projects are on hold. Professionally, I am seeking a long-term career in offensive computer security.
