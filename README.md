<h1>S. G. Sutton</h1>
I’m interested in vulnerability research and exploit development, especially [memory exploitation](https://github.com/s-sutton/sgs_dream_exploit_chain/tree/main) . I’m currently working on my certificates, all other projects are on hold. Professionally, I am seeking a long-term career in offensive computer security.
